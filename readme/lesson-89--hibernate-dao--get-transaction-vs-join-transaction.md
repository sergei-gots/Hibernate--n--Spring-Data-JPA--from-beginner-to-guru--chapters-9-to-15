1. saveNewAuthor method (using getTransaction().begin() and commit()):
   
        @Override
        public Author saveNewAuthor(Author author) {

            EntityManager em = getEntityManager();

            em.getTransaction().begin();
            em.persist(author);
            em.flush();
            em.getTransaction().commit();

            return author;
        }

   Explanation:
   Explicit Transaction Management: In this method, you are explicitly starting and committing a transaction using getTransaction().begin() and getTransaction().commit().

Why?:

getTransaction().begin(): This starts a new transaction. In the case of persist(), you typically want to manage transactions manually, ensuring the entity is correctly inserted into the database.
em.flush(): Forces the EntityManager to push any pending changes to the database (like inserting the author entity) before the transaction is committed.
getTransaction().commit(): This commits the transaction, making sure that all the changes (such as the persisted entity) are saved permanently to the database.
In this case, you are explicitly managing the transaction because you're dealing with a new entity (persist), and you want to make sure the entire transaction is controlled—start it, flush changes, and commit it.

2. updateAuthor method (using joinTransaction() and clear()):

        @Override
        public Author updateAuthor(Author author) {

            EntityManager em = getEntityManager();

            em.joinTransaction();
            em.merge(author);
            em.flush();
            em.clear();     // this em.clear(); clears the first level cache

            return em.find(Author.class, author.getId());
        }
   
    Explanation:
   Joining an Existing Transaction:

    em.joinTransaction(): This tells the EntityManager to join the existing transaction. In contrast to getTransaction().begin(), you don’t start a new transaction here. The method assumes that the transaction is already being handled at a higher level (i.e., outside the method, probably from a service layer). So, joinTransaction() makes the EntityManager participate in the transaction that was already started by a caller.
Why Use joinTransaction()?:

This approach works well in managed environments (like Java EE or Spring) where transactions are typically managed by a transaction manager. The EntityManager is already part of a transaction that’s started earlier in the process (for example, in a service method), and you don’t need to start a new transaction manually.
Using merge():

merge(): This is used to update the entity. Unlike persist(), which is used for new entities, merge() is used to update an existing entity in the database. It synchronizes the state of the entity with the database.
Why Use flush():

You use flush() after merge() to immediately push changes to the database, ensuring that any updates are persisted before clearing the persistence context.
Using clear():

clear(): After calling merge(), you clear the persistence context using em.clear(). This removes all the entities from the first-level cache. This can be useful if you want to release memory or avoid unnecessary tracking of the entity in the current transaction scope.
Why Use find() After clear()?:

The find() call after clear() fetches the updated version of the entity from the database, ensuring you get the most recent state of the entity. Since clear() removes the entity from the persistence context, calling find() is a way to reload the entity after the cache is cleared.
Key Differences in Approach:
Transaction Management:

saveNewAuthor: Starts and commits the transaction explicitly using getTransaction().begin() and getTransaction().commit(). This is required when you're managing transactions manually, usually in a lower-level context.
updateAuthor: Joins an existing transaction using em.joinTransaction(). This is appropriate when the transaction is already being handled by a higher-level framework (such as Spring or Java EE).
Entity Operations:

saveNewAuthor: Uses persist() because you're dealing with a new entity that needs to be inserted into the database.
updateAuthor: Uses merge() because you're updating an existing entity.
Persistence Context:

saveNewAuthor: The persistence context is handled during the transaction, and there’s no need for cache management.
updateAuthor: After updating, you clear the first-level cache (em.clear()) to release memory and ensure that no stale data remains in the persistence context.
When to Use Each Approach:
saveNewAuthor is typically used in a standalone or manual transaction management scenario where you are inserting a new entity.
updateAuthor is usually employed in a managed transaction context (e.g., Spring's @Transactional or Java EE's container-managed transactions), where the transaction is already started, and you only need to join it.
I hope this clears up the difference between the two methods!
