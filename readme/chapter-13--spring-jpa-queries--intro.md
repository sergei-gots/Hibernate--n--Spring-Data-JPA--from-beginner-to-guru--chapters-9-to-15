## Chapter 13 
# Spring Data JPA Queries
### Lesson 97
## Intro

As we can see, Hibernate Queries do have a number of different options and techniques we can use to query data in the database.
So Hibernate does have a very robust offering for that.
Now, this section of the course, we're going to start getting
into Spring Data JPA Queries.
<br><b>This builds upon Hibernate</b>
We can still do everything that we did in Hibernate,
but also Spring Data JPA does give us a number of options
how to query the data, how we get the data back,
whether it's just the object, a stream, an optional.
So, there's a lot that we can do with Spring Data JPA,
and it's basic query methods as well as tapping into
the underlying Hibernate capabilites as well.
And of course, there's always a way to tap into native SQL
so we can always get back to SQL when we need to.
Then after this section of the course, we're going to be taking
back bug chunks of data.
Of course, we want to talk about paging and sorting.
There's capabilities that where we want to add just pages of data
for our clients to be able to query that.
